# Task4
This is a generator of simple Markdown files.

## How to use
To run a ruby file type ```ruby App.rb```.
After you started the script:
1. It will ask you to write the path where to create the file. 
It will use the default path: ``./build/README`` if you have not specified the path or your path does not exist.
2. Then you have to choose one of the HTML or MD file types.

To run the Rakefile, enter in Task 4 folder and type in Terminal: ```rake cleanup```
This removes all README files in the ```build``` folder of the current directory.
